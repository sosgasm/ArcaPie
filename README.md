## Getting Started
The 80's kid in me wanted a portable arcade unit, so I decided to make one. 

I have the privilege to have access to a woodworking space, providing all the tools and materials needed. 
Basic knowledge of woodworking/some linux based OS/computers/electronics might come handy.
If you don't have above, find your resources: Friends, fam, local Hackerspace etc.

### Prerequisites

##### Hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 4 
* 32GB MicroSD card
* 10,5 inch monitor with HDMI/VGA ports (Electronics shop in my hometown)
* Bluetooth Joypad (Ebay) and later an USB NES controller which I still need to test
* Bluetooth Keyboard (Old hardware stash I found at home)

##### Cables:
* usbc --> HDMI
* Power cable for your monitor
* <TODO: insert cables>

##### Software:
* RetroPie, check [RetroPie.org](https://retropie.org.uk/) and [RetroPie Setup](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki)

##### Most used tools:
* Hammer
* Table saw
* Screwdrivers
* Sandpaper
* Scissors
* Drill
* Handsaw


##### Safety:
* Goggles
* Gloves
* Noise cancelling earmuffs

##### Other:
* (Ply)wood
* Wood glue
* Black paint
* Paintbrush
* Stickers (for decoration)
* Screws, whatever you can find

I used the following documentation to install RetroPie:
[RetroPie First Installation](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/First-Installation)

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple: A square or rectangle shaped box with a cut out window for a small monitor.

![Cutout for monitor](https://www.prisamsterdam.com/p_dcim/arcapie/arcapie02.jpg)

##### Cut out six rectangles to create the box:
* With a table saw, cut out 2 rectangles with the following  dimensions: 23.5cm x 35.3cm, 2 rectangles with dimensions 10cm x 35.3cm and another two with dimensions 10cm x 23cm
* Smoothen them with sandpaper
* Take one of the plywood with dimensions 23.5cm x 36.3cm
* Lay the front on the monitor on the plank to draw the outline
* Cut out the outline to create the placeholder for the monitor

##### Decoration:
* I used black paint to paint the plywood. Also cut an outline for the monitor. As you can see in the picture I also cut out an outline and painted it silver.
The stickers are also for decoration, be creative :)
