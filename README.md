## A black box for retrogaming purposes

## Getting Started
The 80's kid in me wanted a portable arcade unit. So I made one. 

I've had the privilege to have access to a woodworking space, providing all the tools I needed. Also I had access to free wood. 
Basic knowledge of woodworking/some linux based OS/computers/electronics might come handy.
If you don't have above, find your resources: Friends, fam, local Hackerspace etc.

### Prerequisites
Use stuff you have and never use. I had my monitor, bluethooth joypad and keyboard for a few years already, doing nothing at all.
So when a friend donated a Pi 3B+ I decided to give them a purpose. 

```

* 32GB MicroSD card
* 10,5 inch monitor with HDMI/VGA ports

```

```

```

```

* Sawtable                                                                                                
* Screwdrivers

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple. It had to be square with a cut out window for the monitor.

```
Steps:

* Decide for youself what the dimensions should be. In my case the size of the box was based on the size 
of my living room and location of the box (wall,table etc.)
* Cut out the 6 sides of your box. For this I used my least favorite tool: the saw table.
I made sure the thickness of the wood was > than the head of the screws I used to attach the planks together.
* Take your time to smoothen the wood with sandpaper, make it free from splinters
