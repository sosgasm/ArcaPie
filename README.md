## A black box for retrogaming purposes

## Getting Started
The 80's kid in me wanted a portable arcade unit. So I made one. 

I've got the privilege to have access to a woodworking space, providing all the tools I needed. Also I had access to free wood. 
Basic knowledge of woodworking/some linux based OS/computers/electronics might come handy.
If you don't have above, find your resources: Friends, fam, local Hackerspace etc.

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple: A square or rectangle shaped box with a cut out window for a small monitor.
![Cutout for monitor](https://www.prisamsterdam.com/img/arcapie/frontbox.jpg)
 
```
Cut out six rectangles to create the box:

* Cut out 6 rectangles with the following  dimensions: <todo:insert dimensions>
* Smoothen them with sandpaper as much as you want
* Take one of the planks with dimensions <todo: insert dimensions>
* Lay the front on the monitor on the plank to draw the outline
* Cut out the outline to create the placeholder for the monitor

Decoration:
* Paint the planks black. Maybe cut out a little outline for the monitor. As you can see in the picture I
cut out an outline and painted it silver. I put stickers on it after.
