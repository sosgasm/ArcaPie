## A black box for retrogaming purposes

## Getting Started
The 80's kid in me wanted a portable arcade unit. So I made one. 

I've had the privilege to have access to a woodworking space, providing all the tools I needed. Also I had access to free wood. 
Basic knowledge of woodworking/some linux based OS/computers/electronics might come handy.
If you don't have above, find your resources: Friends, fam, local Hackerspace etc.

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple. It had to be square with a cut out window for the monitor.

```

Steps:

* Decide the box it's dimensions: <todo: insert dimension>
* Cut out the 6 sides of your box. For this I used my least favorite tool: the saw table.
I made sure the thickness of the wood was > than the head of the screws I used to attach the planks together.
* Smoothen the wood with sandpaper
```
