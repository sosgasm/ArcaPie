## A black box for retrogaming purposes

## Getting Started

I've had the privilege to have access to a woodworking space, providing all the tools I needed. Also I had access to free wood. 
Basic knowledge of woodworking/some linux based OS/computers/electronics might come handy.
If you don't have above, find your resources: Friends, fam, local Hackerspace etc.

### Prerequisites
Use stuff you have and never use. I had my monitor, bluethooth joypad and keyboard for a few years already, doing nothing at all.
So when a friend donated a Pi 3B+ I decided to give them a purpose. 

```

* Raspberry Pi 3B+
* 32GB MicroSD card
* 10,5 inch monitor with HDMI/VGA ports

```
```

```

* Sawtable                                                                                                
* Screwdrivers

## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple. It had to be square with a cut out window for the monitor.
