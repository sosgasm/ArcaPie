## The box
My idea of an arcade box was simple: A square or rectangle shaped box with a cut out window for a small monitor.
![Cutout for monitor](https://www.prisamsterdam.com/img/arcapie/frontbox.jpg)

##### Cut out six rectangles to create the box:
* With a table saw, cut out 6 rectangles with the following  dimensions: <todo:insert dimensions>
* Smoothen them with sandpaper
* Take one of the plywood with dimensions <todo: insert dimensions>
* Lay the front on the monitor on the plank to draw the outline
* Cut out the outline to create the placeholder for the monitor

##### Decoration:
* I used black paint to paint the plywood. Also cut an outline for the monitor. As you can see in the picture I also cut out an outline and painted it silver.
The stickers are also for decoration, be creative
